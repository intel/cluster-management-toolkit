This directory holds pre-defined Ansible playbooks.

Playbooks as used by CMT are a bit stricter than generic Ansible playbooks:

• All playbooks MUST have:
  vars:
    metadata:
      # A description of the action;
      # this is used in the menu of playbook actions
      description: <string>
      summary:
        "Modified files":
        - description: "/path/1"
        - description: "/path/2"
        "Other actions":
        - description: "Foo bar baz"
        "etc"...

• Additionally they MAY set:
  vars:
    metadata:
      # Limit the playbook to these menus; possible values:
      # - internal (never show in any menus; used by internal tasks)
      # - nodes
      # - inventory
      playbook_types: <list>

      # A question to ask before running the playbook
      # string: The question to ask
      # function: The callback to use when inputting the data
      #           valid functions are:
      #           string -- input a string
      #           yesno -- input a boolean; yes/no
      # variable: the variable to set wit the results
      query:
        string: <string>
        function: {string,yesno}
        variable: <string/boolean>

      # Whether or not to allow the playbook to be run on control-plane(s)
      # never -- never allow the playbook to be run on control-plane
      # single -- only allow if control-plane is the only selected node
      # always -- always allow the playbook to be run on control-plane [default]
      allow_on_control_plane: {never,single,always}

      # Ask for confirmation before running the playbook
      confirm: <boolean>

      # Update the inventory with cluster information before running the playbook
      requires_cluster_info: <boolean>

      # A list of playbooks to run before this playbook
      run_before: <list>

      # A list of playbooks to run after this playbook
      run_after: <list>

      # A list of groups to add the host to after the playbook completes
      add_to_groups: <list>

      # A list of groups to remove the host from after the playbook completes
      remove_from_groups: <list>

      # An estimate of time consumption for the playbook
      time_consumption: <string>

      # Whether or not the playbook performs changes;
      # when cmu is started with --read-only all playbooks where read_only: true isn't
      # explicitly set will be ignored
      # true -- The playbook does not perform any changes to cluster, host, or node state
      # false -- The playbook (potentially) performs changes to cluster, host, or node state [default]
      read_only: <boolean>
