This directory holds parser rules

Every file is a list of rules; even files with only one rule must be a list.
If a parser rule should be applied multiple times, such as when filtering out
timestamps, just specify the same rule again.

If you need multiple different rules for a resource depending on the pod/container
combination, but want them all listed as the same parser you can specify the
same name multiple times. Note, however, that such rules cannot be shown
in the selector.

Note that if image_name starts with "/" the match will first strip the server
from the path to the image. This should be the typical case, since other behaviour
won't allow for images fetched from mirrors. In cases where you want to be able
to treat images from different servers differently you simply match against the full URL.

- name: name of the parser (displayed as parser name)
  show_in_selector: Should the parser be shown in the override selector?
    (default: False; Unless the parser is very generic you always want to set this to false)
  matchkeys:
  - pod_name: (matches using startswith)
    container_name: (matches using startswith)
    image_name: (matches using startswith)
