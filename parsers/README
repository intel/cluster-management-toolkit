This directory holds parser rules

Every file is a list of rules; even files with only one rule must be a list.
If a parser rule should be applied multiple times, such as when filtering out
timestamps, just specify the same rule again.

- name: name of the parser (displayed as parser name)
  show_in_selector: Should the parser be shown in the override selector?
    (default: False; Unless the parser is very generic you always want to set this to false)
  matchkeys:
  - pod_name: (matches using startswith)
    container_name: (matches using startswith)
    image_name: (matches using startswith)
  parser_rules:
  - rule
    ...
