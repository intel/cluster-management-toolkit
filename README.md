# About

__Cluster Management Toolkit for Kubernetes__ (CMT) is a set of tools intended
to simplify installation and maintenance of _Kubernetes_ clusters.

Installation and management is done through a combination of _Ansible_ playbooks,
_Python_ scripts, a _curses_-based user interface, as well as calls to _kubectl_
or _kubeadm_ whenever necessary.

Documentation for CMT is available [here](docs/README.md).
