# Introduction

__Cluster Management Toolkit for Kubernetes__ (CMT) is a set of tools intended
to simplify installation and maintenance of _Kubernetes_ clusters.

Installation and management is done through a combination of _Ansible_
playbooks, _Python_ scripts, a _curses_-based user interface, as well as calls
to _kubectl_ or _kubeadm_ whenever necessary.

## Supported platforms

See [supported platforms](Supported_platforms.md#supported-platforms) for more
information.

## Getting started

To get started using _CMT_, the first step is
[installation](Installing_CMT.md#installing-cmt).
