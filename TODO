ALL:
	• How do we handle ansible.posix? We don't have https_proxy set yet in ikt-install, so it's
	  probably not the right place to install it after all. We'd ideally check if it's available
	  when running prepare_node, but ironically the systems that are most likely to need it
	  (the ansible version shipping with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, for instance) doesn't have the
	  ansible-galaxy collection list command, so there's no quick way to query whether it's installed...
	• When running either ikt or iku, check whether .ssh/id_ed25519.pub is in authorized_keys
	  in .ikt/ansible/inventory.yaml; if not, add it

kubernetes_helper:
	• ...

iku:
	• Modify generator_list; ideally every list element should be typed;
	  this way we'd be able to use, for instance:
          [(kind, api_family), address, address, ...]
          and have the (kind, api_family) tuple formatter by that kind of parser,
	  while the addresses are formatter by the address formatter,
	  without having to special case various types of lists.
	  We might even want the list of types be possible to generate on the fly;
	  currently it can only be specified manually.
	  Note: this would need quite a bit of a rewrite, but it would probably be healthy
	  and hopefully cut down on the amount of special cases.
	• Audit and make a list of all necessary types
	• Show if we're running in read-only mode in the status bar
	• Error messages are skipped by the ansible handler
	• config map YAML-parser should handle single-line files (optionally unfolding)
	• Remove the list of valid views from the help text; only show it when using list-views,
	  and populate it the same way we do it in the view selector; also add a note that
	  kinds prefixed with __ are not "real" kinds

iktinv:
	• Optionally limit rebuild-inventory to a subset of clusters

iktadm:
	• Add command to import kube-config (requires cluster-name--unless unique) and a path
	• Pass cluster_name to kubeadm init
	• prepare_passwordless_ansible won't work on localhost; we're not passing the password,
	  and the password might not be the same on the remote system and the local system anyway

logparser:
	• Line too long shouldn't override severity
	  | Ideally max line length should be a.) configurable, b.) trigger line splitting into remnants
	• We cannot replace tabs with spaces in the logparser; we need to do it in the printers instead;
	  this way we know the real line length (due to facility etc. we might not have the same starting point
	  for every line, so expanding tabs into spaces won't work properly)

# We shouldn't need to use kubectl for these actions (ideally we'd do all actions using API calls
# rather than kubectl, but that's a looooong way off)
