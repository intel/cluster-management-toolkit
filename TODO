ALL:
	• We need a better way to handle inventories that takes multiple clusters into account;
	  we shouldn't use control-plane or node without qualifier
	• deep_get should be moved to iktlib

iktadm:
	• prepare_passwordlesss_ansible won't work on localhost; we're not passing the password,
	  and the passowrd might not be the same on the remote system and the local system anyway
	• Once a cluster is fully installed remove the installation info and rely on heuristics for teardown
	  (re-create the file during upgrade/teardown/purge and remove it upon completion of upgrade/purge)
	  | The reason we should do this is that we might want to set up (or import) multiple clusters.
	  | Only remove .kube if all clusters have been purged.

logparser:
	• Line too long shouldn't override severity
	• We cannot replace tabs with spaces in the logparser; we need to do it in the printers instead;
	  this way we know the real line length (due to facility etc. we might not have the same starting point
	  for every line, so expanding tabs into spaces won't work properly)

# We shouldn't need to use kubectl for these actions
