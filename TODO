ALL:
	• How do we handle ansible.posix? We don't have https_proxy set yet in ikt-install, so it's
	  probably not the right place to install it after all. We'd ideally check if it's available
	  when running prepare_node, but ironically the systems that are most likely to need it
	  (the ansible version shipping with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, for instance) doesn't have the
	  ansible-galaxy collection list command, so there's no quick way to query whether it's installed...
	• deep_get should be moved to iktlib
	• When running either ikt or iku, check whether .ssh/id_ed25519.pub is in authorized_keys
	  in .ikt/ansible/inventory.yaml; if not, add it

kubernetes_helper:
	• Add CNI identification for antrea

iku:
	• Error messages are skipped by the ansible handler
	• config map YAML-parser should handle single-line files (optionally unfolding)
	• config map YAML-parser should not have a base-indent by default

iktinv:
	• Optionally limit rebuild-inventory to a subset of clusters

iktadm:
	• Add command to import kube-config (requires cluster-name--unless unique) and a path
	• Pass cluster_name to kubeadm init
	• prepare_passwordless_ansible won't work on localhost; we're not passing the password,
	  and the password might not be the same on the remote system and the local system anyway

logparser:
	• Support for drop-in parser definitions
	• Line too long shouldn't override severity
	• We cannot replace tabs with spaces in the logparser; we need to do it in the printers instead;
	  this way we know the real line length (due to facility etc. we might not have the same starting point
	  for every line, so expanding tabs into spaces won't work properly)

# We shouldn't need to use kubectl for these actions (ideally we'd do all actions using API calls
# rather than kubectl, but that's a looooong way off)
